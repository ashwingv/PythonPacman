This is a project that I did as a part my AI Class @ USC.

Here we took a code for pacman written in python. 
I implemented different AI algorithms, so that the pacman can find its food inside the maze without being hit by the ghosts.

Initially the pacman agent is dumb i.e it cannot find the food inside the maze. 
As we moved through the course we implemented various AI algorithms to enhance the behaviour of thre pacman agent to find
food in the maze.
